## 🌲 What Is canopy?

canopy is a delivery-focused toolkit developed by **phoenix ascend**.
It provides repeatable templates, technical rituals, and quality standards to help teams define *what ready looks like*—from code coverage to deployment readiness.

Whether it’s onboarding a new pipeline, validating release quality, or mapping out design dependencies, canopy is where preparation meets precision.

## ✅ What's Inside

Each tool in canopy is designed to improve a different part of the **delivery quality stack**:

## 🧪 Ideal For

* Teams preparing for production releases
* Engineering leads who care about coverage, quality, and deployment health
* Consultants onboarding quality rituals into delivery orgs

## 🛑 What's Not Included

canopy does not replace test automation frameworks or CI/CD infrastructure.
It supports and guides those systems—but doesn’t compete with or override them.

You bring your own tooling. canopy brings the rigor.

## 📦 Getting Started

canopy is actively used in client work at phoenix ascend and evolves with every delivery.
Starter kits and walkthroughs are coming soon.
