## 🧪 The RAIDS Framework

**Canopy** is guided by the RAIDS framework: five quality pillars that define what “high quality” means in a working software system.

### 🔐 Security

* S1 - No Critical/High Vulnerability from Checkmark Scans for every release package deployed to .Mil
* S2 - Always use the latest stable versions of third party vendor dependencies
* S3 - Code Package Built is the same Code Package Released
* S4 - No Unauthorized use of a Product's Functionality
* S5 - Give Access to only those essentially vital to perform its Intended functions
* S6 - Never use technology that is no longer actively supported by the vendor

### 🧮 Data Integrity

* D1 - Use near to real-time data essential to perform its Intended functions
* D2 - Only valid data points are used
* D3 - Provide accurate data so the customer can make the best business decision
* D4 - All data inputted goes through data transformation

### 🔁 Regression

* R1 - Existing functionality continues to work as new functionality is introduced
* R2 - Implementation Changes do not change functionality
* R3 - Defects are identified before the customer identifies them
* R4 - Existing functionality works as expected when it is needed

### 🔗 Integration

* I1 - Reliably Integrates with service dependencies
* I2 - New Functionality Integrates well with existing functionality
* I3 - Integrated Functionality does not degrade acceptable Performance
* I4 - Code Package Released is compatible with all Integrated needs

### ✅ Acceptance

* A1 - Criteria defined by the customer and understood by Engineer
* A2 - New Functionality Changes work as agreed upon criteria
* A3 - Changes are Only made to provide value to the customer
* A4 - Technical debt is identified before changes are released
